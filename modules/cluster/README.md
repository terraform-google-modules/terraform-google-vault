# terraform-google-vault

## Vault cluster submodule

This submodule gives organizations that have tighter controls over separation of duties, the ability deploy only the Vault cluster and Load balancer, but pass the networking, service account and bucket configuration in without the top level module. This enables a few use cases:

1. Shared VPC architecture where Vault lives in a service project that uses a host project's network
2. Strict permissions around which teams control firewall rules within a shared VPC
3. Migration from an existing Vault cluster where the configuration already exists in a GCS bucket
4. If you already have all the networking bits and you don't want Vault to be entirely isolated in its own network

## Usage

```
module "vault_cluster" {
	source = "terraform-google-modules/vault/google//modules/cluster"
	version = "~> 7.0"

	project_id                  = var.project_id
	host_project_id             = var.host_project_id
	subnet                      = var.subnet_self_link
	ip_address                  = google_compute_address.vault_lb.address
	vault_storage_bucket        = google_storage_bucket.vault.name
  vault_service_account_email = google_service_account.vault-admin.email
	...
}
```

| vault\_addr | Full protocol, address, and port (FQDN) pointing to the Vault load balancer.This is a drop-in to VAULT\_ADDR: `export VAULT_ADDR="$(terraform output vault_addr)"`. And then continue to use Vault commands as usual. |
| vault\_lb\_addr | Address of the load balancer without port or protocol information. You probably want to use `vault_addr`. |
| vault\_lb\_port | Port where Vault is exposed on the load balancer. |
